Hello, world!
Appending new lineCLI automation refers to the process of automating tasks and workflows that are typically performed through a Command-Line Interface (CLI). CLI automation involves writing scripts or using tools that interact with the CLI to execute commands, manage configurations, and handle repetitive tasks without manual intervention.Here are some key aspects of CLI automation:1. **Scripting**: Writing scripts (often in languages like Bash, Python, PowerShell, etc.) to automate sequences of CLI commands. These scripts can handle tasks such as system administration, configuration changes, file operations, and more.2. **Tooling**: Utilizing specialized automation tools that provide interfaces to interact with CLI commands programmatically. Examples include Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Terraform, etc., which facilitate infrastructure management, configuration deployment, and orchestration.

3. **Workflow Automation**: Integrating CLI automation into broader workflows or Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This ensures consistency and efficiency in software development, deployment, and maintenance processes.4. **Task Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks that involve CLI interactions, such as data backups, log analysis, software updates, and system monitoring.5. **Configuration Management**: Using CLI automation to manage and enforce configurations across multiple systems or environments. This includes setting up users, installing software packages, configuring network settings, etc.Benefits of CLI automation include increased productivity, reduced errors (since automation minimizes manual intervention), scalability (automated tasks can be easily repeated across many systems), and improved consistency in system configurations and deployments.Overall, CLI automation is crucial in modern IT operations and software development for achieving efficiency, reliability, and agility in managing and deploying systems and applications.CLI automation refers to the process of automating tasks and workflows that are typically performed through a Command-Line Interface (CLI).
